# Pace Calculator

This program is a pace calculator written in java. It will hopefully serve as a framework for future projects using the Java Swing forms available in Netbeans IDE. If you have any suggestions on ways to improve the project, feel free to open a feature request or an issue form to let me know. Right now, it is completely text based, but as mentioned above, there will be a GUI version to come in the future.

To use it, you can either download the repository and run it from  an ide such as Eclipse or Netbeans, or if you know how to compile it yourself, you can run the file from the terminal.
